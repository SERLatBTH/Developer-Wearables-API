## Postman collection ##
`Mars.postman_collection.json` is a collection for Postman to be able to test the API.
Each API call has to be modified to the correct URL and change the sample values in Headers, Body and Params to reflect your setup.
Not all headers/body content/params are necessary and can be checked/unchecked to only add/export data that you want. For more information
about optional/required values, look at API documentation.
